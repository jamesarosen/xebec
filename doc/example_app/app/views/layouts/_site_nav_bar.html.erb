<%= 
  # If you want to keep your navigation code in your views, you might
  # want to use partials like this one. Notice that this tag is an
  # "output" tag (<%= %> as opposed to <% %>). That means that the
  # navigation bar will be rendered as a list here. If you want to
  # modify a navigation bar in a view without rendering it, use a
  # non-outputting tag.
